# [SRAD_Avionics](https://github.com/Terrapin-Rocket-Team/SRAD_Avionics)

This repository is one that I have contributed substantially to over the course of my time at UMD. Along with [Varun Unnithan](@varun-un), I made significant overhauls to the structure of the code run by the flight computer, better implementing the OOP benefits that C++ provides over C. I am very proud of the work I did on it, improving reliability, portability, and readability, and believe it to be a good indicator of my level of knowledge about C++. It uses a brand-new Multi-Mission Flight Software (MMFS) framework, which I designed and wrote almost entirely myself.

Note that I did not do any work on the Live Video or Radio systems, almost all of which was researched and implemented by [Joseph Hauerstein](@jhauerst).

I also spent a significant amount of time writing documentation for nearly every part of the MMFS repository. Found on that repo's [github pages](https://terrapin-rocket-team.github.io/Multi-Mission-Flight-Software/) is a nearly complete string of documents designed to both document our code and teach new members that may have never worked with Arduino before how to set up their coding environment. The plan is for new members in the fall semester to be sent there and given a small bogus assignment designed to help them walk through how to code for our systems. This will help them become more capable than past new members, faster.
