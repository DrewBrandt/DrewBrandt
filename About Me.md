## About Me

A few years ago, when I was working a dead-end job at HomeGoods, I had a nasty conversation with a manager who had recently promoted me. After that conversation, I became the third person in as many weeks to quit from my newly-promoted-to position. I quickly realized that I was not happy with the state of my life: a college dropout with no real career prospects. I decided then to go back to school and get a degree.

Unfortunately for me, I couldn't decide which degree I wanted and spent an extra year going from CS to Engineering and back. After settling on CS, I finished out my AS and transferred to the University of Maryland. My first semester there, I joined the Terrapin Rocket Team and quickly jumped headfirst into their Avionics sub team. I am expecting a BS in Computer Science in May 2026. After that, I plan on continuing my education and earning a master’s in aerospace engineering.

Besides my academic interests, I have an affinity for musical theatre. I do part-time lighting design work for a small community theatre in my hometown. I very much enjoy listening to and watching popular musicals. This keenness for theatre has also led to a curiosity for animation and 3D modeling. While those are much less of a hobby for me now that I’m in school, they remain a topics I am quite interested in.

My winding journey has taught me much about determination, resilience, and self-reflection. I am excited to see where my education takes me and what I will accomplish in my career.
