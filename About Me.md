## About Me

A few years ago, when I was working a dead-end job at HomeGoods, I had a nasty conversation with a manager who had recently promoted me. After that conversation, I became the third person in as many weeks to quit from my newly-promoted-to position. I quickly realized that I was not happy with the state of my life: a college dropout with no real career prospects. I decided then to go back to school and get a degree.

Unfortunately for me, I couldn't decide which degree I wanted and spent an extra year going from CS to Engineering and back. After settling on CS, I finished out my AS at Anne Arundel Community College and transferred to the University of Maryland. My first semester there, I joined the Terrapin Rocket Team and quickly jumped headfirst into their Avionics sub team, which quickly consumed nearly all of my free time. I am expecting a BS in Information Science in December 2026.

Besides my academic interests, I have an affinity for musical theatre. I do part-time lighting design work for a small community theatre in my hometown. I very much enjoy listening to and watching popular musicals. This keenness for theatre has also led to a curiosity for animation and 3D modeling. While those are much less of a hobby for me now that Iâ€™m in school, they remain topics I am quite interested in.

This... convoluted... journey has taught me much about determination, resilience, and self-reflection. I am excited to see where my time on the rocket team takes me and what I will accomplish in my career.
