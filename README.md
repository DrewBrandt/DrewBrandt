## Hello there! 

I am an information science major studying at the University of Maryland. I have a passion for problem solving and aerospace engineering. I do not commit to many public repositories, but you can see some of the work I've done and a small blurb about each of them below.

I have basic knowledge of C#, C++, and Python. I am on UMD's Terrapin Rocket Team (TRT) (See the bottom left-hand side) and have contributed substantially to their flight software and custom hardware capabiltiies.

My resume is [here](https://github.com/DrewBrandt/DrewBrandt/blob/main/Current%20Resume.pdf). You can also read a little bit more about me [here](https://github.com/DrewBrandt/DrewBrandt/blob/main/About%20Me.md).

If you have any questions, you can reach me at ahbrandt@umd.edu.

The first pinned repo is the SRAD Avionics one from TRT. You can read a personal paragraph about it [here](https://github.com/DrewBrandt/DrewBrandt/blob/main/About%20SRAD_Avionics.md).

Next is a library I wrote for use in TRT, but which is applicable to any Arduino system. Read about why I included it on my profile [here](https://github.com/DrewBrandt/DrewBrandt/blob/main/About%20BlinkBuzz.md).

Finally, the last pinned repo is a personal project that I worked on for more than a year designed to run theatre shows in a small community theatre. [Here](https://github.com/DrewBrandt/DrewBrandt/blob/main/About%20DeLight.md) is some more information about it.
