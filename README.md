Hello there! 

I am a computer science major studying at the University of Maryland. I have a passion for Machine Learning and Aerospace engineering (my plan is to earn a master’s in AE after completion of my CS degree). I don’t currently have any repositories that I’ve worked on linked here, as I contributed somewhat anonymously to them. 

I have basic knowledge of C#, Java, and Python. I am a member of the Terrapin Rocket team (See the bottom left-hand side) and hope to contribute substantially to their Avionics and Space Shot sub teams. 

If you have any questions, you can reach me at ahbrandt@umd.edu.
