## Hello there! 

I am a computer science major studying at the University of Maryland. I have a passion for machine learning and aerospace engineering (my plan is to earn a master’s in AE after completion of my CS degree). I do not commit ot many public repositories, but you can see the work I've done on UMD's Terrapin Rocket Team (TRT) pinned below.

I have basic knowledge of C#, C++, and Python. I am on TRT (See the bottom left-hand side) and hope to contribute substantially to their Avionics and Space Shot sub teams. 

My resume is [here](https://github.com/DrewBrandt/DrewBrandt/blob/main/Current%20Resume.pdf). You can also read a little bit more about me [here](https://github.com/DrewBrandt/DrewBrandt/blob/main/About%20Me.pdf).

If you have any questions, you can reach me at ahbrandt@umd.edu.
